## Execute-with-Retries

A tiny, dependency-free retry utility with fixed delay or built-in exponential backoff, designed for predictable behavior in modern TypeScript applications.
<br/><br/>
🚨 **Async-only support**
`executeWithRetries` supports **only async callbacks** (functions that return a `Promise`).
Synchronous functions are not supported and must be wrapped in an async function if needed.

### 📦 Installation

```console
npm install execute-with-retries
```

### 🎲 Features

1. Zero dependencies
2. No side effects (no logging by default)
3. Functional (not class-based)
4. Works in both client-side and server-side JavaScript environments
5. Preset Default and tiny configuration surface
6. Async-only by design
7. No hooks, no events, no middleware

### 📚 API Signature

```javascript
executeWithRetries<T>(
  callback: () => Promise<T>, /* arguments are not passed directly; use closures instead */
  options?: {
    retries?: number;
    delay?: {
      type: "fixed" | "exponential";
      ms: number;
    };
  }
): Promise<T>
```

### 🔤 Example Usage

1. Basic Usage: Retrying an Operation

```javascript
import { executeWithRetries } from 'execute-with-retries';
const apiResponse = await executeWithRetries(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Request failed');
  } else {
    return response.json();
  }
});

/*
Note: Default Settings:
Retries: 3 Nos
delay = { type: "fixed", ms: 300 }
*/
```

2. Custom Retry Count Param

```javascript
import { executeWithRetries } from 'execute-with-retries';
const apiResponse = await executeWithRetries(
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    return response;
  },
  { retries: 5 },
);

/* Note: Retries the operation up to 5 times before failing. */
```

3. Fixed Delay Between Retries

```javascript
import { executeWithRetries } from "execute-with-retries";
const apiResponse = await executeWithRetries(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return response;
}, {retries: 3, delay: {type: "fixed", ms: 1000}});

/* Note: Waits 1 second between each retry attempt.
```

4. Exponential Backoff Implementation

```javascript
import { executeWithRetries } from 'execute-with-retries';
const apiResponse = await executeWithRetries(
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    return response;
  },
  { retries: 3, delay: { type: 'exponential', ms: 500 } },
);

/* Note: Delay Pattern:
   First Attempt: 500ms
   Second Attempt: 1000ms
   Third Attempt: 2000ms
   ...and so on.
*/
```

5. Passing Data via a Top-Level Function

```javascript
import { executeWithRetries } from "execute-with-retries";
async function getUserDetails(userId: number): Promise<Record<string, any>> {
  return executeWithRetries(async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch user");
    } else {
      return await response.json();
    }
  });
}
const userInfo = await getUserDetails(100);
```

### 📗 Test Coverage

```
PASS src/execute-with-retries/test/index.test.ts
  executeWithRetries
    ✓ resolves on first attempt without retries
    ✓ retries failures and resolves when a later attempt succeeds
    ✓ throws immediately when retries is set to 0
    ✓ throws after all retry attempts fail

PASS src/execute-with-retries/test/calculate-delay.test.ts
  calculateDelayMs
    ✓ returns fixed delay milliseconds for fixed type
    ✓ computes exponential delay based on attempt
    ✓ caps exponential delay at 10000ms
```
